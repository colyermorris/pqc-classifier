# Project Charter

## Purpose
Provide reliable classification of PQC algorithm family and NIST security level from lightweight features to support inventory, compliance, and migration planning.

## Objectives
- Build reproducible data pipeline and model baselines.
- Publish model cards with clear limitations and governance.
- Deliver a minimal API and dashboard for inspection.

## Out of Scope
- Implementing cryptographic primitives.
- Production key management or HSM integration.

## Stakeholders
- Research lead, engineering, compliance, and partner reviewers.

## Success Criteria
- Reproducible end-to-end pipeline.
- Documented dataset limits and refresh plan.
- Passing acceptance checks for WP-00 through initial modeling WPs.
